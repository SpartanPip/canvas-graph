webkitGetAsEntry is used to read files in the uploaded directory. This is supported in most Chromium-based browsers so I recommend using Chrome.

## Available Scripts

In the canvas-graph directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
